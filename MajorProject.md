    * Topics are often a starting point for discussion
    * Some topics may have several Projects
* Will be able to submit your own project suggestion for review
    * Involve conversations with Supervisors with a backgound in the area

##Semester 1
Timeframe | Activity
--------- | ---------
2nd week of Oct | Website that lists project topics from Supervisors. Will also be able to submit ideas

Early-Mid Nov | Website allows you to indicate a choice of three topics, in order of preference. One can be a project that you have suggested
By end of term | Will have been allocated a project and supervisor

* Can only select one topic from a particular supervisor
* Select topics, not Supervisors

##Semester 2
* Weekly meetings with Supervisors
* A 10-minute demo midway through the work to the second marker
* A 20 minute demo at the end of the work
* Final report of 20,000 words
* Technical work showing what you have done

##Second marker
* As well as supevisor, will have a Second marker
* Usually a different supervisor
* Not necessarily knowledgable about project topic
* There as another opinion
* Supervisor and Second Marker will be responsible for marking your work


##Ethics
* All projects will need to get Ethics approval
* Ethics covers things such as approriate handling of data, and more advanced issues covering work with humas and animals
* Most likely issue is with user testing. Rules about what you might do and what is allowed
* Part of University's approach to handling Ethics
