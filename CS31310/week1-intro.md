##Introduction

In 1986, Fred Brooks wrote a paper called "No Silver Bullet: Essence and Accident in Software Engineering".

In the paper, he talks about how there can be no single development in technology or management styles that can promise even one order of magnitude improvement in a decade in:
* Productivity
* Reliability
* Simplicity

The software industry has traditionally approached large development projects like building a bride or a sky scraper, which is how we have things like the Waterfall model.

Engineers in other disciplines have established "best practices" in how to:
* Analyse requirements
* Establish a design
* Proceed to building
* Test and verify that the result matches the requirements

Do these approaches always deliver successful software systems?

To improve things, Brooks suggested:
* New computer languages to increase productivity
* Using third-party software and components where possible, so that not everything has to be built and tested from scratch.

##Essence and Accident

In his paper, Brooks explores where ideas like these are "accidents".
* Not that they happen by chance, but that they are incidental.

Solving the accidents will help with small gains in productivity, but do they solve the core problem - the essence of software engineering.

##Is There A Silver Bullet?

Is there a silver bullet that can solve these accidents, and if so does it tackle the core problems?

In Brooks' paper, he didn't see anything on the horizon.

##This Week
* More on Brooks' paper
* Early papers on the Waterfall model
* Big ideas from Agile & Agile manifesto
