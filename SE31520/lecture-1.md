#Introduction Lecture
*Chris Loftus, A6 Llandinam*

##Why study this topic?
* Building Internet-based applications is a significant area of software engineering
* Look at web-based Business-to-Consumer (B2C) and Business-to-Business (B2B) applications
* Design issues and techniques when building applications
    * Design patterns
    * Testing techniques
* A lot of time looking at code and design issues

##Two Parts

###Part One
* Building web applications using Ruby on Rails
* Introduction to Cloud/Heroku with Neil Taylor (nst)

###Part Two
* Web security
    * Introduction to cryptography
    * Language security models
        * e.g. Java security models
    * Code injection attacks
        * e.g. SQL injection
    * Single Sign-on

##Why Ruby on Rails?

* Widely used
* Makes it easy to make C.R.U.D. web services
* 80:20 rule
    * 80% of the time it's good enough
    * 20% of the time it's too slow
* Excellent user/developer community
* Lots of good reusable components

##Ruby is...
* Pure Object-Oriented
* Dynamically typed
* Scripting Language

##Dynamically Typed Vs. Statically Typed
* Dynamically typed languages are slower
* You can't guarantee the type of a variable in a dynamically typed language
* Dynamically typed languages are powerful

##Two Main Philosophies
* Don't repeat yourself
    * Define things only once
* Convention over Configuration
    * Lots of sensible defaults out-of-the-box, so that there is not lots of configuration with XML files
    * Code generators can provide a barebones MVC architecture
